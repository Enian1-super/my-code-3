    <h1 id="ex1">Draper returns</h1>
    <img id="right" src="draper.webp" alt="foto" style="height: 300px;width: 170px;">
    <p id="ex2">British number one Jack Draper said he felt "really proud" after marking his post-injury return to action on the ATP
    Tour with a straight-set victory over Frenchman Quentin Halys in Dubai.
    
    Competing on the men's tour for the first time since the US Open last August, Draper won 7-6 (10-8) 6-3 on his debut at
    the Dubai Tennis Championships.
    
    The 24-year-old, who has slipped to 15th in the world after reaching a career-high ranking of fourth in June, will play
    Hungary's Fabian Marozsan or France's Arthur Rinderknech next.
    
    "I've been craving the feeling of competing for a very long time," Draper said in his post-match interview.
    
    "It just felt normal, it felt like I was coming back to doing what I love, which is being out here, competing and having
    the adrenaline of winning and losing points.
    
    "A lot of people have helped me to get back to this position after a lot of down moments [during] the last eight months.
    
    "It's not been easy to be back here and that's something I can be really proud of. Long may it continue."
    
    Draper contested his first competitive match for 164 days when he played at the Davis Cup qualifiers earlier in
    February, beating Norway's Viktor Durasovic in straight sets.
    
    But he had remained absent from tour singles competition since withdrawing from the US Open before his second-round
    match because of a left arm injury six months ago.
    
    Draper won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French
    Opens in a promising start to his 2025 season.
    
    But he began struggling with a bruised bone in his service arm during the clay-court swing in April, and the issue
    progressively worsened.
    
    Determined to complete a full recovery from the issue, Draper took the decision to miss the Australian Open in January
    before making his return for Great Britain on 5 February.
    
    Seeded fourth in Dubai, Draper had to withstand a set point when serving at 5-4 down in the opening set but went on to
    edge a tight tie-break by winning three consecutive points to overcome an 8-7 deficit.
    
    Despite first-set opportunities for both players, the first break of serve in the contest did not arrive until the
    fourth game of the second set when the 68th-ranked Halys hit wide to give Draper a 3-1 lead.
    
    Draper served out victory untroubled from there, conceding just two further points on serve as he ending the match with
    an impressive 86% win rate on his first serve.
    
    The left-hander's successful recovery from injury was also underlined by the fact 19 of his 24 winners flew off his
    previously affected forehand side.</p>

    <h2 id="ex3">De Minaur shocked</h2>
    <img id="left" src="deminaur.webp" alt="foto" style="height: 300px;width: 300px;">
    <p id="ex4">Patrick Kypson earned the biggest win of his career on Monday at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC, where
    he shocked second seed Alex de Minaur 6-1, 6-7(4), 7-6(4) to reach the second round in Acapulco. With the victory, the
    American notched his first tour-level win since Indian Wells in 2024.
    
    De Minaur was competing in his first tournament since claiming the Rotterdam crown two weeks ago. The last two times he
    competed in Acapulco, he left as champion, having captured back-to-back titles in 2023 and 2024. In stark contrast,
    Kypson had only earned three tour-level wins, all in 2024.
    
    "It feels amazing," Kypson said. "Everything was important. I had to serve well. I had to return well. I hit my forehand
    really big. Luckily, I was able to do those things for a pretty extended period of time."
    
    Kypson was two points from defeat when De Minaur served for the match at 5-4 in the decider. But the American qualifier
    held firm to force the tie-break and sealed a hard-fought win in two hours and 39 minutes. He won 71 per cent (48/68) of
    his first-serve points and converted three of the five break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats.</p>
