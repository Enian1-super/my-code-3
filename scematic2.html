                <article>The semifinals of the 2026 Australian Open delivered two five-set marathons that pushed the sport’s physical and mental
                limits and set up a final few would have predicted at the start of the fortnight.
                
                Carlos Alcaraz reached his first Australian Open final after surviving the longest semifinal in tournament history,
                outlasting Alexander Zverev in a brutal five-hour, 27-minute epic that swung repeatedly on momentum, fitness, and nerve.

                Later in the evening, Novak Djokovic turned back the clock in a four-hour battle with Jannik Sinner, saving break points
                at will and snapping a five-match losing streak against the defending champion to reach his first Grand Slam final since
                Wimbledon 2024.
                
                Two matches, nearly ten hours of tennis, and a final that pits the world No. 1 against the most decorated player the
                sport has ever seen. Will they both be up to it physically? Let’s hope so.</article>
                <aside>Alcaraz won 70 percent of his service points and 34 percent of the return points in his match against Zverev. He hit 78
                winners, while making 58 unforced errors. However, what stood out in this match for the Spaniard was his mental
                fortitude. Having won the first two sets, it looked like smooth sailing for the 22-year-old.
                
                However, late in the third set, Alcaraz developed an injury scare, which impaired his movement. As a result, the
                Spaniard did not invest much energy in the return games and only focused on his own serve. This gave Zverev the window
                of opportunity, and he won the next two sets in tiebreaks.
                
                In the fifth set, the German player got the early break and was leading 5-3 and had all the momentum. But Alcaraz, who
                had recovered sufficiently by then, mounted a terrific comeback and won four straight games to win the match.</aside>
